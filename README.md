# Health Checks

ASP.NET Core offers Health Checks Middleware and libraries for reporting the health of app infrastructure components.

Health checks are exposed by an app as HTTP endpoints. Health check endpoints can be configured for various real-time monitoring scenarios:

* Health probes can be used by container orchestrators and load balancers to check an app's status. For example, a container orchestrator may respond to a failing health check by halting a rolling deployment or restarting a container. A load balancer might react to an unhealthy app by routing traffic away from the failing instance to a healthy instance.
* Use of memory, disk, and other physical server resources can be monitored for healthy status.
* Health checks can test an app's dependencies, such as databases and external service endpoints, to confirm availability and normal functioning.

Health checks are typically used with an external monitoring service or container orchestrator to check the status of an app. Before adding health checks to an app, decide on which monitoring system to use. The monitoring system dictates what types of health checks to create and how to configure their endpoints.
